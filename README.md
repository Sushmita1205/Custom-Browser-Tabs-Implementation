# Dynamic Tabs with Search Bar

A web application that allows users to dynamically create and manage tabs with embedded content. It includes a search bar for quick web searches, utilizing different search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. The project uses a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic Tab Management**: Users can create new tabs by clicking the "+" button. Tabs can be closed individually, and the active tab is highlighted.
- **Search Bar Integration**: The search bar allows users to perform web searches, with results opening in a new browser tab.
- **Drag-and-Drop Tabs**: Tabs can be reordered using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Persistent Tab State**: Tab information is saved in local storage, so the tab state is preserved even after refreshing the page.
